# Accessibility
## Overview

WCAG is a set of guidelines, created by the W3C, for making digital content accessible for all users, including people with disabilities.

## Accessibility Levels

After defining the 4 principles, WCAG defined 3 differents levels, the two first being absolutely required for any business and website. AAA level is recommended but not required as it may have bigger impacts on designs.
### Levels
- Level A (required)

A: This level improves accessibility for most sites by making it easier for browsing readers to navigate a site and translate its content, but it is still pretty basic.
- Level AA (required)

AA: This level makes content accessible to people with a wider range of disabilities by providing guidance on elements such as color contrast and error identification. Regulators prefer this level.
- Level AAA (optional)

AAA: The highest level of accessibility compliance, this makes content accessible to the widest range of people, but it can significantly alter the design of a site. Government legislation doesn’t typically require this because it’s not always possible to conform.

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

ARIA is a specification from the W3C and created to improve accessibility of applications by providing extra information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, via attributes which could be added to HTML.

## Keyboard Navigation

Some people can’t use a mouse to navigate on webpages. It’s important to test your pages using only the keyboard (some people only use a switch button to navigate and do tasks on a device).
